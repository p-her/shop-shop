    /*  useEffect() Hook here has to first check to see if there's data in our global state's
        products array. If there is, we use it to figure out which product is current
        one that we want to display. It does this finding the one with the matching _id value 
        that we grabbed from the useParams() Hook. 


        But what happens if we don't have any products in our global state object? What happens 
        if someone just sent you this product's URL and this is the first time you've loaded this application?

        If that's the case, then you wouldn't have any products saved in global state just yet. 
        The useEffect() Hook is set up so that if we don't, we'll use the product data that we returned from 
        the useQuery() Hook to set the product data to the global state object. When that's complete, we run 
        through this all over again. But this time, there is data in the products array, and then we run 
        setCurrentProduct() to display a single product's data.

        This is why there are so many items in the second argument of the useEffect() Hook. The Hook's functionality
        is dependent on them to work and only runs when it detects that they've changed in value! This is known as the dependency array.

        It's a lot of back and forth, but it works! But what about our second question? Why are we saving 
        the current product locally and not to the global state?

        This is one of those cases where saving a single product to the global state object doesn't actually benefit us in any way, shape, or form.
        The single product's data will only be used in this specific component at this specific moment. This is the same reason why we don't worry 
        about saving form entry data from the login or signup forms to global state; it only needs to exist when we're using those components!
